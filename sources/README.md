# Tektur sources

The preferred modification format is FontLab 7 `.vfj`.
The `UFO/*.designspace` files are not as exported from FontLab and should not be overwritten.

## Exporting FontLab sources to UFO

1. Export `DesignSpace+UFO` from FontLab (Destination: Source, Subfolders by: none).
2. For each master, build `mark/mkmk` features in FontLab and export them using the `exportFeatures.py` script from within FontLab. This is preferred because FontLab cannot export correct `mark/mkmk` for each master on its own and only exports these features as created, duplicating one masterâ€™s features in all masters. (Google Fonts is no better and strips mark attachment features from the webfonts altogether, but whatever).
3. Move the `masters` directory from `/sources/FontLab/` to `/sources/UFO/`.

## Building the fonts

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Create a `virtualenv` if you like. Install prerequisites from `/requirements.txt`.

1. Open terminal in `/sources`. Run `./build.sh`.
